# Disease-Prediction-using-Symptoms
We set out to create a system which can predict disease on the basis of symptoms given to it. Such a system can decrease the rush at OPDs of hospitals and reduce the workload on medical staff. We were successful in creating such a system and use 4 different algorithm to do so. On an average we achieved accuracy of ~94%.
# Problem Statement
1) Current situation in the healthcare industry
2) The correct prediction of disease is the most challenging task.
3) With the help of disease data, data mining finds hidden pattern information in the huge amount of medical data.
4) This project is based on disease prediction according to the symptoms shown by the patient

# Work Flow
In this project we have used four different algorithms 

Decision Tree Classifier

Random Forest

K-Nearest Neighbour

Naive Bayes Classifier

All the four Algorithms predict the disease as a result when the user enter  the symtoms of diseases.

Our Dataset consist of training and testing file which contains 5000+ rows to predict the diseases.

All the used algorithm gives an accuracy of more than 90%.
